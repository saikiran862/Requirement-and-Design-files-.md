## 3. Objectives
- Enable efficient and sustainable use of natural resources
- Improve income stability for rural communities
- Support climate-resilient agricultural planning
- Provide low-tech, accessible AI insights

## 4. Target Users
- Farmers
- Village Panchayats
- Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Low internet dependency
- Scalable from village to district level
- Easy-to-understand insights (non-technical)
- Secure and reliable data handling

## 7. Constraints
- Limited digital literacy
